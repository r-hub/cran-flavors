Tests of memory access errors, on x86_64 Linux (currently Fedora 36).

There is a directory for each package with a 00check.log file documenting the
package version and the version of R used.  For {gcc,clang}-ASAN this may
also report errors, including from examples.

How to run and interpret these (with links to further information) is in ยง4.3 of 'Writing R Extensions'.  The settings used are listed by sub-directory in the rest of this file.

Results for archived packages will likely have been made with earilier 
versions of the compilers.


clnag-ASAN
Using clang 19 built with libc++/libc++abi as the default C++ library,
and flang-new 19 as the Fortran compiler. Note that the latter does
not yet support sanitizers.
[For a version built to default to libstdc++ (as shipped by Debian/Ubuntu),
add -stdlib=libc++ to the CXX line and install the libc++-dev package.]

config.site:
CC="clang -fsanitize=addres-fno-omit-frame-pointer"
CXX="clang++ -fsanitize=address,undefinedt -fno-omit-frame-pointer -frtti"
CFLAGS="-g -O3 -Wall -pedantic  -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3"
CXXFLAGS="-g -O3 -Wall -pedantic -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3"
FFLAGS="-O2 -pedantic"

and environment variables
setenv ASAN_OPTIONS detect_leaks=0
setenv RJAVA_JVM_STACK_WORKAROUND 0
setenv RGL_USE_NULL true
(alloc-dealloc mismatches were seen in system libraries used by rgl)
setenv R_DONT_USE_TK true
(There were ASAN errors in X libraries called from Tk initialization.)

[Results prior to 2024-02-17 were made with clang 16 and gfortran 13.2.]


clang-UBSAN:
Using clang 19 built with libc++/libc++abi as the default C++ library,
and flang-new 19 as the Fortran compiler. Note that the latter does
not yet support sanitizers.
[For a version built to default to libstdc++ (as shipped by Debian/Ubuntu),
add -stdlib=libc++ to the CXX line and install the libc++-dev package.]

An unaltered build of R was used, but each package was tested with 
R_MAKEVARS_USER pointing to a file containing

CC=/usr/local/clang19/bin/clang -fsanitize=undefined -fno-sanitize=function -fno-omit-frame-pointer
CXX=/usr/local/clang19/bin/clang++ -fsanitize=undefined -fno-sanitize=function -fno-omit-frame-pointer -frtti

UBSAN_DIR = /usr/local/clang19/lib/clang/19/lib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
SAN_LIBS = -L$(UBSAN_DIR) -Wl,-rpath,$(UBSAN_DIR) -lclang_rt.ubsan_standalone

as discussed in 'Writing R Extensions'.

[Results prior to 2024-02-17 were made with clang 16 and gfortran 13.2.]


gcc-ASAN, gcc-UBSAN:
gcc 14.1 with config.site:

and environment variables
setenv ASAN_OPTIONS 'detect_leaks=0'
[RcppParallel is run adding detect_odr_violation=0]
setenv UBSAN_OPTIONS 'print_stacktrace=1'
setenv RJAVA_JVM_STACK_WORKAROUND 0
setenv RGL_USE_NULL true
setenv R_DONT_USE_TK true


valgrind:
Running R CMD check --use-valgrind with an instrumented (level 2) build of R,
currently using valgrind 3.21.0 on Fedora 38.

configured by:
.../configure -C --with-valgrind-instrumentation=2

and formerly --with-system-valgrind-headers

with config.site:

CFLAGS="-g -O2 -Wall -pedantic -mtune=native"
CXXFLAGS="-g -O2 -Wall -pedantic -mtune=native"
FFLAGS="-g -O2 -mtune=native"
FCFLAGS="-g -O2 -mtune=native"

and environment variables

setenv RJAVA_JVM_STACK_WORKAROUND 0
setenv R_DONT_USE_TK true

The following valgrind suppression file is used:

{
   Suppression for wcsrtombs
   Memcheck:Cond
   fun:__wcsnlen_sse4_1
   fun:wcsrtombs
   fun:wcstombs
}

{
   Suppression for do_makename
